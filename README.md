Autonomous AI Agents

Saken AI runs on specialized AI agents that work together like a real product team.

Each agent has a clear role. Each agent works independently. And they coordinate automatically.

Meet the Agents

Vlad — Code Agent
Writes, refactors, and improves code in real time.

Ivar — Product Dev Agent
Breaks down ideas into tasks, defines features, and structures execution.

Bjorn — Deployment Agent
Reviews builds, manages releases, and handles deployment workflows.

Agnes — Design Agent
Designs interfaces, improves layouts, and ensures visual consistency.

How It Works

Instead of you manually switching between tools or roles:

The Product Agent defines the plan

The Design Agent prepares the interface

The Code Agent builds the feature

The Deployment Agent reviews and ships it

All inside one workspace.

You give direction.
The agents execute.

What Makes This Different

Most tools give you AI assistance.

Saken AI gives you an AI team.

Agents don’t just respond to prompts — they:

Work in parallel

Handle tasks independently

Update status in real time

Move projects forward without constant input

You’re not micromanaging tools.
You’re directing a system.

If you want, I can now:

Turn this into landing page copy

Write a bold manifesto-style section

Or position this as “The First Autonomous Product Workspace” and make it sound big.

Make it a README

Here’s a product-focused README centered fully on autonomous AI agents:

Saken AI

Saken AI is an autonomous product workspace powered by AI agents.

It doesn’t just assist you.
It works for you.

The Idea

Building software usually means juggling planning tools, design software, code editors, version control, and deployment platforms.

Saken AI brings everything into one system — powered by specialized AI agents that operate like a real product team.

You give direction.
The agents execute.

Autonomous AI Agents

Saken AI runs on role-based AI agents that work independently and collaboratively.

Each agent owns a responsibility.
Each agent updates status in real time.
Each agent moves the project forward.

Vlad — Code Agent

Writes, refactors, and improves code.
Handles implementation and technical updates.

Ivar — Product Development Agent

Breaks ideas into structured tasks.
Defines features and organizes execution.

Bjorn — Deployment Agent

Reviews builds, manages releases, and handles deployment workflows.

Agnes — Design Agent

Designs interfaces, improves layouts, and maintains visual consistency.

How It Works

You describe what you want to build.

The Product Agent structures the work.

The Design Agent prepares the interface.

The Code Agent builds the feature.

The Deployment Agent reviews and ships it.

All inside one workspace.

No switching tools.
No fragmented workflow.
No constant micromanagement.

What Makes Saken AI Different

Most platforms offer AI suggestions.

Saken AI provides an AI team.

Agents work in parallel

Tasks update automatically

Status is visible in real time

Progress continues without constant prompts

You are not managing tools.
You are directing a system.

Tech Stack

Vite

TypeScript

React

shadcn/ui

Tailwind CSS

Vision

Software creation should feel like a continuous flow — not a chain of disconnected tools.

Saken AI is built to replace the tool stack with a coordinated, autonomous system.
